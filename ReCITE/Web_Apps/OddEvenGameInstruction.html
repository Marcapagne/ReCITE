        <h1> General Instruction: </h1>
        <p> The game will start when the instructor presses the "NEW Button." The student's name will automatically
            appear on the upper part of the screen, and they will guess the number that will show on the screen if it is
            "ODD" or "EVEN." When the student guesses were RIGHT, they will be safe on the recitation but, if the
            student guesses were WRONG, the instructor would ask if they wanted to use the "POWER-UPS."
        <p>

        <p>There are three (3) choices, the "HUDDLE UP," which allows all students to help the selected student. Next is
            the "PASS," which enables the student to skip the recitation. And lastly, "CALL A FRIEND" allows the
            students to ask for someone's assistance. However, if they do not want to use their power-ups, they will
            proceed to recitation. </p>

        <p>The instructor will assess if the student's response is acceptable. It will receive a point. On the right
            part of the screen, you will see the leaderboard. </p>
