        <P>The game will start when the instructor presses the "START" button. The name
            of the students are randomly selected like a Lottery. When there's a name
            selected, the student will recite or answer the question given by the
            instructor. When the student have the RIGHT answer, they will gain a POINT that
            be shown in the leaderboard, if not, the student have a opportuniy to use
            "POWER-UPS".</P>
        <P>There are three (3) choices, the "HUDDLE UP," which allows all students to
            help the selected student. Next is the "PASS," which enables the student to skip
            the recitation. And lastly, "CALL A FRIEND" allows the students to ask for
            someone's assistance. However, if they do not want to use their power-ups, they
            will proceed to recitation. </P>
        <P>The instructor will assess if the student's response is acceptable. It will
            receive a point. On the right part of the screen, you will see the leaderboard.
