        <p>The game will start when the instructor presses the "START." The student's name will automatically appear on
            the screen, and they will guess which wire is the safest. If the student guesses the SAFETY wire, they are
            safe in recitation, and the game will proceed. However, if they choose the WRONG wire, the bomb will
            explode, the instructor would ask if they wanted to use the "POWER-UPS."</p>

        <p>There are three (3) choices, the "HUDDLE UP," which allows all students to help the selected student. Next is
            the "PASS," which enables the student to skip the recitation. And lastly, "CALL A FRIEND" allows the
            students to ask for someone's assistance. However, if they do not want to use their power-ups, they will
            proceed to recitation. </p>

        <p>The instructor will assess if the student's response is acceptable. It will receive a point. On the right
            part of the screen, you will see the leaderboard. </p>
